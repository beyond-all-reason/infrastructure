# Components

Infra is spread across many different repositories, with different functions. On
this page is a current comprehensive list (index like) of everything that BAR
infrastructure consists of.

> [!INFO]
> Even though many of the repositories below are hosting UI visible to players,
> the infrastructure team is not responsible for the design and overall UX
> improvements. The same applies to rating, balancing and data analysis. Other
> BAR development teams are supposed to drive planning and improvements to those
> aspects.

## Live games serving

The server side components responsible for facilitating live games: hosting the
engine instances clients connect to to play the game.

- [Yaribz/SPADS]: Game lobby room hosting and engine handling on game servers.
- [spads_config_bar]: Spads configuration, bar manager plugin, official plugins
  configuration.
- [ansible-spads-setup]: Overall game servers configuration.
- [p2004a/recoil-host]: Work in progress [tachyon] protocol autohost.

There is also some monitoring setup: health checks using
[healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) and Okema's
[Zabbix instance](https://zabbix.bar.gaming.rodeo/).

## Lobby rooms serving

The online components needed to set up and prepare the lobby rooms before the
game happens.

- [teiserver]: The primary piece here responsible for all the:

    - Account management logic
    - Moderation
    - Lobby rooms permissions and management
    - Middleware between client side components and SPADS

    [hailstorm] are the integration tests.

- [ansible-teiserver]: Teiserver server configuration.
- [tachyon]: Work in progress new lobby server protocol specification.
- Even though the SPADS and its configuration is mentioned in the previous
  section, it also belongs here. SPADS is handling both lobby rooms setup and
  then game handling.

## Client side infra

Pieces responsible for ensuring that players have all the assets available and
ready to start the game.

- [BYAR-Chobby]: Our current lobby client.

    It's responsible for communication with lobby server, launcher, preparing
    engine start script.

- [bar-lobby]: New work in progress lobby client.
- [spring-launcher]: Game installer and launcher.
    - [flathub/info.beyondallreason.bar]: Linux Flatpak package for launcher.
- [pr-downloader]: CLI application distributed with engine used for downloading
  mods/games

    Could be interpreted also to belong in the engine team, but it heavily
    impacts infra.

- [bar_debug_launcher]: BAR Debug launcher. It's not intended for end users,
  it is a developer tool.

## Game assets distribution

Infrastructure responsible for making all the game assets available to players.

- [RapidTools]: Packaging of game git repo to rapid format.
- [rapid-hosting]: Rapid build server configuration.
- Game CDN distribution: CDN management and syncers to CDN.
    - [p2004a/spring-rapid-syncer]: Rapid repo syncer from builder host to CDN.
      Also includes a prober to for debugging CDN replication issues.
    - [p2004a/bar-repos-bunny-replication-lag-mitigation]: Helper to make sure
      updates to CDN are pushed in consistent way.
    - [p2004a/rapid-pool-init]: Builder for the initial rapid game download.
      package.
- [p2004a/springfiles-mirror]: Map CDN: publishing, serving, IaC setup.
- Maps metadata setup
    - [maps-metadata]: Main repo that transforms data and distributes to other
      places via GitHub actions. Also contains source for a few server side
      components of that system.
    - Maintenance of [https://rowy.beyondallreason.dev/](https://rowy.beyondallreason.dev/) (deployment with [custom BAR patches](https://github.com/p2004a/rowy/tree/bar-fork)).

## Auxiliary services

- BAR Live services (replays, leaderboard, battles linked as `iframe`s from [www.beyondallreason.info](https://www.beyondallreason.info/)):
    - [Jazcash/bar-db]: Backend service, effectively [https://api.bar-rts.com/](https://api.bar-rts.com/)
    - [Jazcash/bar-live-services]: Frontend embeded in main website [https://bar-rts.com/](https://bar-rts.com/)
- Teiserver contains some additional functionality in this category:
    - Microblog
    - Discord bot
    - Engine crash logs
- [logs-upload]: Small Cloudflare worker to handle log upload from launcher.
- Main website is created in [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) and not part of BAR
  infrastructure.
