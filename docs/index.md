# Welcome

This documentation site describes the components of the [Beyond All Reason](https://www.beyondallreason.info/) (BAR) Infrastructure and how they connect to each other.

On a very high level:

}

}
```

Infrastructure contains all the software, configuration, and resources that support the running of the [Beyond All Reason](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason) game on the [Recoil Engine](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/RecoilEngine), which includes: lobby server, launcher, game files hosting, multiplayer game servers, server management, and more.

Please explore the site for any information that you are interested in. If you are just starting, we recommend looking at the [more detailed system overview](current_infra.md). If you would like to help out, check out the [contributing page](contributing.md).
