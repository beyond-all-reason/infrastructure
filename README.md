> Work in progress, *nothing* useful yet.

This repository contains **documentation** and **issue tracking** for Beyond
All Reason (BAR) Infrastructure area.

BAR Infrastructure area contains all the software, configuration and resources
that support running of the [Beyond All Reason](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason)
game on the [Recoil](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/spring) engine: lobby
server, launcher, game files hosting, multiplayer game servers, servers
management etc. Each of those components is stored in it's own separate
repository and *this* repository works as a documentation and issue tracking
bridge across them.
